# Usage
This is your migration workspace. Here you can set up and test an elasticsearch migration.

It has:
* Local elasticsearch containers for testing locally.
* Example scripts to help with common tasks like installing index templates.
* Tooling to set up new elasticsearch clusters.
* Tooling to run the migration itself.

# Set up elasticsearch
Check out [aws-opensearch-refarch](https://github.com/gosquared/aws-opensearch-refarch).

# Install templates
See [examples/template.ts](https://github.com/gosquared/es-migrate/blob/main/examples/template.ts)

# Open network access
Allow your new cluster to connect to the existing one.

For example, on AWS, allow tcp port 9200 in the security group.

# Prepare transforms
Change documents in-flight.
